# Mode: batch — Bulk Offer Processing

Two modes of use: **conductor --chrome** (navigates portals in real-time) or **standalone** (script for already collected URLs).

## Architecture

```
Claude Conductor (claude --chrome --dangerously-skip-permissions)
  │
  │  Chrome: navigates portals (logged-in sessions)
  │  Reads DOM directly — the user sees everything in real-time
  │
  ├─ Offer 1: reads JD from DOM + URL
  │    └─► claude -p worker → report .md + PDF + tracker-line
  │
  ├─ Offer 2: clicks next, reads JD + URL
  │    └─► claude -p worker → report .md + PDF + tracker-line
  │
  └─ End: merge tracker-additions → applications.md + summary
```

Each worker is a child `claude -p` process with a clean 200K token context. The conductor only orchestrates.

## Files

```
batch/
  batch-input.tsv               # URLs (via conductor or manual)
  batch-state.tsv               # Progress (auto-generated, gitignored)
  batch-runner.sh               # Standalone orchestrator script
  batch-prompt.md               # Prompt template for workers
  logs/                         # One log per offer (gitignored)
  tracker-additions/            # Tracker lines (gitignored)
```

## Mode A: Conductor --chrome

1. **Read state**: `batch/batch-state.tsv` → know what's already been processed.
2. **Navigate portal**: Chrome → search URL.
3. **Extract URLs**: Read result DOM → extract list of URLs → append to `batch-input.tsv`.
4. **For each pending URL**:
   a. Chrome: click on the offer → read JD text from the DOM.
   b. Save JD to `/tmp/batch-jd-{id}.txt`.
   c. Calculate next sequential REPORT_NUM.
   d. Execute via Bash:
      ```bash
      claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions \
        --append-system-prompt-file batch/batch-prompt.md \
        "Process this offer. URL: {url}. JD: /tmp/batch-jd-{id}.txt. Report: {num}. ID: {id}"
      ```
   e. Update `batch-state.tsv` (completed/failed + score + report_num).
   f. Log to `logs/{report_num}-{id}.log`.
   g. Chrome: go back → next offer.
5. **Pagination**: If no more offers → click "Next" → repeat.
6. **End**: Merge `tracker-additions/` → `applications.md` + summary.

## Mode B: Standalone script

```bash
batch/batch-runner.sh [OPTIONS]
```

Options:
- `--dry-run` — lists pending without executing.
- `--retry-failed` — only retries failed ones.
- `--start-from N` — starts from ID N.
- `--parallel N` — N workers in parallel.
- `--max-retries N` — attempts per offer (default: 2).

## Format batch-state.tsv

```
id	url	status	started_at	completed_at	report_num	score	error	retries
1	https://...	completed	2026-...	2026-...	002	4.2	-	0
2	https://...	failed	2026-...	2026-...	-	-	Error msg	1
3	https://...	pending	-	-	-	-	-	0
```

## Resumability

- If it dies → re-run → reads `batch-state.tsv` → skip completed.
- Lock file (`batch-runner.pid`) prevents double execution.
- Each worker is independent: failure in offer #47 does not affect the others.

## Workers (claude -p)

Each worker receives `batch-prompt.md` as its system prompt. It is self-contained.

The worker produces:
1. Report `.md` in `reports/`.
2. PDF in `output/`.
3. Tracker line in `batch/tracker-additions/{id}.tsv`.
4. JSON result via stdout.

## Error Management

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| URL inaccessible | Worker fails → conductor marks `failed`, next. |
| JD behind login | Conductor tries to read DOM. If fails → `failed`. |
| Portal changes layout | Conductor reasons about HTML, adapts. |
| Worker crashes | Conductor marks `failed`, next. Retry with `--retry-failed`. |
| Conductor dies | Re-run → read state → skip completed. |
| PDF fails | Report .md is saved. PDF remains pending. |
